Unlike classical computers that use bits representing 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits that can exist in superposition, representing both states simultaneously. This property, combined with quantum entanglement, allows quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. Companies like IBM, Google, and startups are racing to build practical quantum computers. The technology promises breakthroughs in cryptography, drug discovery, financial modeling, and optimization problems that are currently intractable for traditional computers.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet has long been celebrated as one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. Originating from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, this diet emphasizes whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, olive oil, fish, and moderate amounts of dairy and wine. Research consistently shows that people following this diet have lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. The anti-inflammatory properties of olive oil, combined with omega-3 fatty acids from fish and antioxidants from produce, create a powerful nutritional profile. Beyond physical health, the Mediterranean lifestyle promotes social eating and mindful enjoyment of meals.", "meta": {"title": "TXT corpus: quantum.txt", "tags": ["txt"], "id": "corpus_txt__quantum", "format": "txt", "loader_options": {}}}
